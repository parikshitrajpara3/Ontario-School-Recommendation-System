# School Recommendation System

This project is an interactive machine learning-based school recommendation system designed to assist users in finding schools that best match their preferences based on academic performance, enrollment, and proximity. The system utilizes K-means clustering to group schools with similar characteristics and recommends schools accordingly.

## Features

- **Machine Learning-based Recommendations**: The system uses K-means clustering to categorize schools based on academic performance, enrollment, and distance preferences, providing relevant recommendations.
- **User Preferences**: Users can input their preferences for factors like academic performance, enrollment size, and proximity to generate personalized school recommendations.
- **Interactive Interface**: Deployed using Streamlit, the web application provides a user-friendly, interactive experience for quickly receiving school recommendations.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core programming language for developing the machine learning model and backend logic.
- **K-means Clustering**: Used to group similar schools based on the specified features for recommendations.
- **Streamlit**: A Python framework used to deploy the app and create an interactive user interface.
